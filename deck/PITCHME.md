## Getting started with Spring Boot as a Node.js developer

### 20th June 2019

---

### Please feel free to jump in with any questions at any point during the webinar

---

### What we will cover

* What the JVM is and how it works with your application
* What Maven is and how to use it
* How to create a Spring Boot application quickly and easily using the online generator
* A walkthrough of a simple RESTful application with database connectivity

---

### What this is not

* A walkthrough of basic Java concepts
* A comparison between Express.js/Loopback and Spring Boot
* A production-ready implementation (e.g. no tests!)

---

## Prerequisites

---

* Java 8 installed on your system
  * `brew tap caskroom/versions`
  * `brew cask install java8`
* Maven 3 installed on your system
  * `brew install maven` (if it is not already installed, check with `maven -version`)
* A Java IDE (I use IntelliJ community edition, but Eclipse is also good)
  * `https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/`
  * `https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/`

---

## Let's go!

---

### Please clone the following repository from Github

#### https://github.com/kslat3r/spring-boot-webinar
#### Navigate to the `src/` directory in a text editor or import the project into your IDE

---

## JVM

>  Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode.

---

#### JVM architecture

---

#### Features of the JVM

* Platform independence 
  * Write once, run anywhere
* Memory management
  * Memory allocation
  * Garbage collection
* Exception handling
  * Issues in your application will not affect the underlying OS

---

* Security
  * Sandbox environment for execution of application code that disallows interaction with OS resources
* Memory safe references
* Multiple implementations (languages)
  * Scala
  * Kotlin
  * Jython
  * Jruby

---

#### Benefits of the JVM

* Run your code on any operating system that implements the JVM specification
* Multiple choices of implementation of the specification
  * OpenJDK HotSpot
  * Oracle JDK/JRE
* JIT compilation

---

#### Negatives of the JVM

* Performance
  * Java bytecode cannot be optimised for a specific hardware set
* Single point of failure
  * If the JVM has a bug, it may cause your application to fail
* Memory footprint
* Startup time

## Maven

---

>  Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

---

## POM

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

#### Features of Maven

* Simple project setup
* Dependency management
* Large repository of managed third-party libraries
* Build system for JARs, WARs and distrubuted build models
* Extensible with plugin system
* Release management and distribution publication

https://maven.apache.org/maven-features.html

---

#### How Maven is not NPM

* Built in build/deploy system over custom scripts
* More declarative syntax
* Dependency resolution
  * Picks a single version of a dependency
* More mature and quality-controlled ecosystem (Maven Central, Nexus)
